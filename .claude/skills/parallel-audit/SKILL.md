# parallel-audit

## Purpose

Long agent-instruction markdown files (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, SKILL.md) accumulate subtle defects over time: missing qualifiers, terminology drift between sections, implicit premises, ad-hoc enumerations, cross-section logical contradictions. A single audit pass — even a careful one — misses some defects and over-flags others.

The fix is to dispatch **multiple independent audits in parallel** and treat findings that **multiple independent auditors flag** as the high-confidence signal. Findings flagged by only one auditor are likely noise; findings flagged by ≥ threshold (default 2 of 3) are likely real.

This skill implements that workflow end-to-end: symptom triage → scope narrowing → parallel dispatch → reproducibility aggregation → false-positive filtering → redundancy classification → fix drafting → safety check → per-fix user approval → apply → post-fix verification → convergence check.

## Positioning: event-driven diagnostic, not routine maintenance

**This skill is designed for specific symptoms, not for daily / weekly / scheduled use.** The 7-axis taxonomy is generic enough that auditors will always find *something* in any prose, and the residual findings reach an asymptote that no number of iterations clears. Routine use therefore wastes tokens on noise the user already saw last time.

Intended trigger events:

- **Right after a large refactor** (added or restructured multiple rules) — new wording often contains undetected cross-section contradictions
- **A specific rule appears to be ignored / misapplied** — focused audit on that section + neighbors can surface conflicting rules or unstated premises
- **Observed agent behavior drift** — diagnostic to isolate whether the instruction file is the cause vs. model / hooks / prompt
- **After a Claude model upgrade** — wording the previous model accepted may parse differently now
- **`N` session learnings have accumulated** (e.g., via revise-claude-md) — incremental additions are a known source of cross-section contradictions

Anti-pattern: "let me run this weekly to keep my CLAUDE.md clean." The skill explicitly warns on routine selection in Phase 1 and asks the user to confirm before proceeding.

Defaults reflect the diagnostic positioning: `N=3` (not 9), `threshold=2` (not 4), `max_iterations=3` (not 5). Users can opt into the deeper `N=9` configuration in Phase 2 when the case justifies the cost.

## When to use

Trigger this skill when the user:

- Asks to **audit / review / verify / quality-check** an instruction file (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, SKILL.md)
- Wants to find **omissions / inconsistencies / contradictions / coherence issues** in such a file
- Mentions **multi-agent audit**, **parallel review**, **convergence audit**, **independent verification**, **audit my SKILL.md**, **review my CLAUDE.md after refactor**
- Reports a **specific symptom** (rule being ignored, behavior drift, post-refactor verification)
- Wants high-confidence reproducibility on long instruction file defects

Do NOT use this skill for:

- Writing a new CLAUDE.md from scratch (use `init` or `claude-md-improver`)
- Updating CLAUDE.md with session learnings (use `revise-claude-md`)
- Template-based gap analysis (use `claude-md-improver`)
- Authoring a brand new SKILL.md or running with-skill vs without-skill A/B benchmarks (use `skill-creator`)
- Auditing non-instruction files (source code, regular docs, READMEs)

## Target types

The skill detects `target_type` from the target file path (case-sensitive — the Claude Code spec requires uppercase `SKILL.md` / `CLAUDE.md`) and loads the corresponding specifics document:

| Target type | Detection | Specifics document |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-md` | Path ends in `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md` | `references/claude-md-specifics.md` |
| `skill-md` | Path ends in `SKILL.md` | `references/skill-md-specifics.md` |

The specifics documents own: target-type-specific exclusion defaults, target-type-specific common false-positive patterns, target-type-specific Phase 11 behavior (e.g., CLAUDE.md inside `~/.claude/` triggers the auto-mode classifier; SKILL.md inside `plugins/<name>/skills/<name>/` does not), and any target-type-specific Phase 11.5(c) integration (currently SKILL.md only, via `skill-eval` static check).

Read the relevant specifics document **once** at Phase 2 after `target_type` is determined. Pass its content as additional context to Phase 4 auditors via the exclusion list, to Phase 7 redundancy-checker as the upstream-reference set, and to Phase 11 as the apply playbook.

Also read `references/shared-blind-spots.md` once at the same time, regardless of `target_type`. It carries the target-type-agnostic known-FP patterns (e.g., the `(N − threshold + 1)` "missing rationale" pattern) that apply equally to both target types. Phase 6.5 (`false-positive-detector`) should receive the union of (target-specifics entries) + (shared-blind-spots entries) as one combined known-FP set, so a shared pattern is recognized regardless of which target type triggered the audit.

## Configuration parameters

Defaults shown. Phase 2 asks the user to confirm or override.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `target_file` | (from initial message, or asked) | Absolute path of the file to audit |
| `target_type` | (auto-detected) | `claude-md` or `skill-md` (from file path) |
| `N` | 3 | Number of parallel auditor subagents per iteration. Must satisfy `2 ≤ N ≤ 9` (single-instance results are not convergence; values above 9 are not validated by the cost table — see Phase 2 input validation). Opt-in to 5 or 9 for deeper convergence |
| `threshold` | 2 | Minimum instances that must flag an issue for it to be considered reproducible. Must satisfy `2 ≤ threshold ≤ N − 1` (see Phase 2 input validation — `threshold == N` is rejected because it makes `(N − threshold + 1) = 1` and a single clean instance vacuously satisfies practical-convergence, defeating the multi-agent premise); the percentage agreement implied by `threshold/N` varies by tier — see Default calibration below |
| `max_iterations` | 3 | Hard upper bound on audit→fix→verify cycles. Must satisfy `2 ≤ max_iterations ≤ 10` (see Phase 2 input validation — `max_iterations < 2` makes the Phase 11.5(a) re-dispatch gate `iteration < max_iterations` never fire, silently skipping post-fix verification; values above 10 accept cost for noise per the asymptote). Reflects the empirically observed asymptote |
| `exclusions` | (asked, with target-type defaults pre-loaded) | Items the user does NOT want re-flagged. See `references/<target>-specifics.md` for pre-loaded defaults |
| `section_purposes` | (built at Phase 3) | Map from each section heading to its 1-line purpose; established once per audit and reused across iterations |
| `ab_testing_enabled` | `false` | Whether Phase 11.5(b) runs a `skill-eval` A/B benchmark after fixes. Opt-in only; requires `skill-eval` to be installed separately (it is not bundled in this marketplace). See `references/ab-testing.md` |
| `model_string` | `"sonnet"` | The string passed as the Agent tool's `model` parameter for Phase 4 parallel auditors. Default `"sonnet"` resolves to the current Sonnet generation at dispatch time. The user may override at Phase 2 by specifying a full model ID (e.g., `"claude-sonnet-4-6"`) for version-pinned reproducibility across an audit |

### Default calibration

Why these defaults?

- **`threshold = 2` (≥2/3 ≈ 67%)** — chosen over majority (50%) and supermajority (75%) framings on the default `N=3` tier. At 67% (≥2/3), one missed-by-one-auditor real defect is still recovered by the other two. Pushing to a hypothetical 75% framing — which would require something like `N=4 / threshold=3` (a tier this skill does NOT offer) — demands three auditors to independently converge on the same true positive, too restrictive for genuine HIGH-severity prose defects given inter-instance variance. Loosening to a 50% framing re-admits single-pair false positives that the multi-agent design was built to filter. Note: the 67% framing anchors on default `N=3`. At opt-in `N=5 / threshold=3` the bar is 60%, and at `N=9 / threshold=4` it is 44% — deeper tiers buy redundancy (more independent corroborators in absolute count), not stricter percentage agreement.
- **`N = 3`** — minimum N for ≥2 to be meaningful (2/2 is unanimous; 2/3 is convergence). Higher N (5, 9) buys statistical power but multiplies cost and rarely changes the convergent-issue set for files under ~500 lines.
- **`max_iterations = 3`** — empirically observed asymptote (see Positioning section). Iterations 4+ tend to produce diminishing real defects and increasing noise from previously-discussed exclusions.
- **`model_string = "sonnet"`** — Phase 4 is the only place this skill overrides parent-model inheritance. The ≥threshold aggregation absorbs per-instance noise, so Sonnet's HIGH-severity prose detection quality should suffice at much lower per-token rates than Opus. *This choice is inferred from per-task fan-out economics, not empirically benchmarked* — if you observe Sonnet missing convergent defects in your runs, override `model_string` at Phase 2 to a more capable model. Phases 6.5 / 7 inherit the parent model because each runs a single judging subagent with no peer to absorb per-instance noise. Phase 9 fans out one safety-checker per fix (or per option), but each judges its own fix in isolation — there is no cross-fix aggregation, so each individual safety verdict needs parent-level quality.

## Workflow

The skill runs in phases grouped as **Pre-check → Setup → Detect → Triage → Fix → Apply → Verify**. Each phase has a clear precondition and output. Do not skip phases unless explicitly noted.

---

### Pre-check

#### Phase 1: Symptom interview (always)

Read `references/symptom-interview-protocol.md` and follow its protocol to structure the user's reason for invoking the skill. Use **AskUserQuestion** to present the symptom options. Possible answers shape the rest of the workflow:

- **Post-refactor verification** → keep full-file scope in Phase 1.5; standard exclusions
- **Specific rule ignored / misapplied** → Phase 1.5 narrows to that rule + neighbors
- **Behavior drift** → full-file scope; consider `ab_testing_enabled: true` in Phase 2
- **Pre-shipping check** (SKILL.md before publishing a plugin) → full-file scope; ensure Phase 2.5 static check runs
- **Post-model-upgrade isolation** → full-file scope; standard exclusions
- **Routine maintenance** → emit warning per `references/symptom-interview-protocol.md` and require explicit confirmation to proceed

The symptom answer is stored as `symptom` and passed to Phase 1.5 to determine scope, and to Phase 11.5(b) decision.

#### Phase 1.5: Scope narrowing (always)

Based on the Phase 1 `symptom`, choose audit scope:

- **Full file** (default for most symptoms): auditors read the entire `target_file`
- **Section scope** (when symptom names a specific section): auditors read only the named section ± 30 lines of surrounding context
- **Rule-and-neighbors scope** (when symptom names a specific rule being ignored): auditors read the rule ± 20 lines AND grep the rest of the file for terms appearing in the rule, reading any other section that references those terms

For non-full scopes, the prompt placeholder `scope_directive` (substituted in Phase 4) tells auditors which lines to read instead of the whole file. This typically cuts per-instance token usage to 1/3–1/5 of full-file audit.

Confirm the chosen scope with **AskUserQuestion** before proceeding (one option per scope type plus "let me specify lines").

---

### Setup

#### Phase 2: Inputs + exclusions (always)

Use **AskUserQuestion** to collect:

1. **Target file path** (absolute path) — if not already provided in the user's initial message
2. **Confirm `target_type`** — show the auto-detected value, let the user override
3. **Confirm `N` / `threshold` / `max_iterations`** — defaults `3 / 2 / 3`. Offer an "opt into deep audit (N=5 or N=9)" option for cases where the user wants stronger convergence; show the per-iteration cost estimate for each tier. **Validate the chosen values before proceeding** (all three must be positive integers; reject non-integer / negative / non-numeric values with a stated re-ask):
   - `N` must satisfy `2 ≤ N ≤ 9`. Reject `N < 2` (single-instance results are noise, not convergence — the entire workflow premise depends on multiple independent reads). Reject `N > 9` (the cost table tops out at the Deep tier 9/4; values above 9 are not validated and may exceed practical budget without warning). The three supported tiers are exactly Quick `3/2`, Standard `5/3`, Deep `9/4`; if the user enters another N, recommend the nearest tier.
   - `threshold` must satisfy `2 ≤ threshold ≤ N − 1`. Reject `threshold > N` (makes `(N − threshold + 1)` ≤ 0 and the Phase 12 practical-convergence condition vacuously true on iteration 1 → silent instant stop with no audit). Reject `threshold < 2` (collapses to single-instance signal). Reject `threshold == N` (makes `(N − threshold + 1) = 1` so a single clean instance satisfies practical-convergence — the same single-instance signal the `N ≥ 2` floor exists to prevent).
   - `max_iterations` must satisfy `2 ≤ max_iterations ≤ 10`. Reject `max_iterations < 2` (Phase 11.5(a)'s gate `iteration < max_iterations` would never fire at `max_iterations = 1`, silently skipping post-fix verification; user expecting "1 audit cycle" still needs at least 2 to get verify). Reject `max_iterations > 10` (asymptote observation says ≥4 iterations rarely produce new real defects; values above 10 are accepting cost for noise).
   - **Re-ask cap**: if the user enters an invalid combination, re-ask up to **3 times total** (initial attempt is attempt #1; re-asks are attempts #2 and #3). After the 3rd attempt fails, present a final AskUserQuestion with three options:
     - **(a) "Use defaults `3/2/3` and proceed"** — explicit user-chosen defaults, not silent coercion. Choosing this resumes Phase 2 at step 4 (Exclusions) with the default parameter triple confirmed; subsequent steps (4 / 5 / 6) still run normally — the only thing finalized is the N / threshold / max_iterations triple, NOT the rest of Phase 2.
     - **(b) "Abort this audit"** — hard abort. The audit ends here; the user sees a single-line summary of their last attempt (what they entered, which constraint failed, how to re-invoke with valid parameters) so they can recover without restarting from Phase 1 blind.
     - **(c) "Try once more"** — one additional input attempt (attempt #4). If this attempt is also invalid, the workflow hard-aborts as in option (b); the menu does NOT re-arm (no attempt #5). Effective cap is 4 attempts when (c) is chosen, 3 attempts otherwise.
4. **Exclusions** — pre-load defaults as the union of `references/<target_type>-specifics.md` "Exclusion defaults" + `references/shared-blind-spots.md` "Shared exclusion defaults" (the latter applies regardless of target_type). Present the merged list as multi-select for deselection, accept free-text additions for skill-specific intentional design. While reading both files for exclusion defaults, also assemble `known_fp_patterns` as the union of the target-specifics "Common shared-blind-spot patterns" section + the shared-blind-spots "Shared known-FP patterns" entries. Store `known_fp_patterns` as a setup-time artifact passed unchanged to every Phase 6.5 dispatch (per the Verification subagents table input column). This is separate from the user-edited `exclusion_list` and not presented for user editing — the entries are pre-validated FP patterns, not exclusions
5. **A/B testing** — `ab_testing_enabled`? Default `false`. Show `references/ab-testing.md` cost estimate (the multiplier ranges from ~1.7× at the smallest task/trial configuration up to ~9× at the largest — see that file's cost table for sizing against the user's actual benchmark configuration) so the user can decide
6. **`model_string` override** (only when the user wants version-pinned reproducibility — usually skip and let default `"sonnet"` resolve at dispatch time). AskUserQuestion supports free-text via its built-in "Other" option, so present an AskUserQuestion with a small set of fixed candidates (the default `"sonnet"`, the current Sonnet generation ID, the current Opus generation ID if the user wants stricter detection) and let the user type a custom model ID via "Other" if needed. Capture the resulting string and pass to Phase 4 dispatch unchanged.

The exclusion list is critical — without it, subagents will repeatedly flag intentional design as "issues" and convergence will never be reached.

#### Phase 2.5: Static pre-check (SKILL.md target only, when `skill-eval` is available)

Per `references/skill-md-specifics.md`, if `target_type == "skill-md"` AND the `skill-eval` skill is installed AS AN EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY, run its `static_check.py` and capture the result. This (a) hard-fails the audit if the SKILL.md is structurally broken, (b) gives Phase 4 auditors a baseline of structural axes already covered so they don't re-flag them, and (c) calibrates Phase 2 defaults for short / long SKILL.md bodies.

**Important**: `skill-eval` is NOT bundled in this marketplace (`almondoo-claude-plugins`). The integration is preserved as an optional capability: if the user has installed `skill-eval` from a different source (or has its source available on disk), the orchestrator can invoke it. If not installed, Phase 2.5 is **skipped without error** (log a one-line warning "Phase 2.5 skipped — `skill-eval` not available; structural axes will not be pre-cleared from the prose audit"). Resolution strategy for the skill-eval path is documented in `references/skill-md-specifics.md`.

When Phase 2.5 successfully produces a `static.json`, append the conditional skill-eval exclusion item (the conditional one in `references/skill-md-specifics.md` — currently item #4 after iter-4's renumber moved the `subagent_type` exclusion to `references/shared-blind-spots.md`) to the Phase 2 exclusion list **before Phase 4 dispatches**, so auditors receive the skill-eval delegation context and do not re-flag axes already covered.

If `target_type == "claude-md"`, skip Phase 2.5 entirely (the structural-axis delegation is SKILL.md-specific).

#### Phase 3: Section purposes baseline (always)

Phase 9 (`fix-safety-checker`) needs an explicit baseline of what each section is intended to do. Without this baseline, "intent preservation" gets judged by re-reading the same section the fix is editing — circular reasoning that can quietly accept fixes that distort intent.

Process:

1. Read `target_file` with Read (full file regardless of audit scope — the baseline must cover the whole file).
2. For each top-level heading (`## H2`) and meaningful sub-section (`### H3`), draft a 1-line purpose summary based on what the section's rules collectively do.
3. Present all section purposes as a **batch** via AskUserQuestion. Show the full list in the question description (one section per line: `## section-name → 1-line purpose`), then offer "All purposes look right" / "Some need correction — let me revise".
4. Store the confirmed purposes as `section_purposes`. Pass to Phase 7 (`redundancy-checker`) and Phase 9 (`fix-safety-checker`).

This phase runs once per audit, not per iteration.

---

### Detect

#### Phase 4: Parallel audit dispatch (always)

Read `agents/auditor.md` and use its full content as the prompt for each subagent. Substitute the placeholders (`target_file_path`, `related_files_paths`, `exclusion_list`, `scope_directive` from Phase 1.5) with the values collected so far. The prompt must be **byte-identical** across all N instances — same placeholder substitution, no per-instance variation.

Dispatch all `N` subagents in **one tool-call message** with `run_in_background: true`, `subagent_type: general-purpose`, and `model: <model_string>` (the resolved `model_string` value from Phase 2 — see next paragraph).

Pass `model_string` (default `"sonnet"`) to the `model` parameter — always pass it explicitly, even when the parent is already Sonnet, so the dispatch shape stays uniform. The user may override at Phase 2 with a full model ID (e.g., `"claude-sonnet-4-6"`) for version-pinned reproducibility; the same value is reused across iterations. Phase 4 is the **only** place this skill overrides parent-model inheritance — at Opus-level parent rates, N × iter cost would explode, and the ≥threshold aggregation absorbs per-instance noise so Sonnet's HIGH-severity detection quality suffices. Phases 6.5 / 7 inherit the parent model because each runs a single judging subagent with no peer to absorb per-instance noise. Phase 9 fans out one safety-checker per fix (or per option), but each judges its own fix in isolation — no cross-fix aggregation exists, so each individual safety verdict needs parent-level quality too.

Critical requirements:

- All N subagents launched in the **same tool-call message** with `run_in_background: true`
- The prompt is `agents/auditor.md` content with placeholders substituted — byte-identical across instances
- Do NOT append "be honest" / "no sycophancy" / "be thorough" — the user's CLAUDE.md Forthright Assessment rules already cover this; extra instructions bias the audit
- Do NOT modify the 7 axes, output format, or "what not to flag" section in `agents/auditor.md` per-iteration. Touch only the placeholders.

**Failure handling for partial returns**: subagents can time out, return malformed (non-table) output, or never complete. Track the number of instances that returned parseable HIGH-issue output (`N_received`) versus dispatched (`N_dispatched`). If `N_received < N_dispatched`:

- Adjust the working threshold for this iteration to `max(2, ceil(N_received × threshold / N_dispatched))` so the convergence math is not broken by silent drop-outs. Never go below 2 — a single auditor's report is not "convergence". Trade-off: this lowers the *absolute count* of corroborators (e.g., `N=9 / threshold=4 / N_received=6` drops to working_threshold=3 — 3 of 6 instead of 4 of 9). The *percentage* threshold can drift in either direction depending on the rounding (e.g., 44% → 50% in the above case, but 60% → 67% in `N=5 / threshold=3 / N_received=3`). If your bar is the absolute count (e.g., "I require at least 4 independent flags before I act"), the alternative policy is to abort the iteration entirely on any drop-out and re-dispatch with a fresh N. The proportional formula is the default to keep audits from stalling on transient failures; switch to the abort-and-redispatch policy when count-based convergence is non-negotiable.
- If `N_received < 2`, abort the iteration and report the degradation to the user before re-dispatching or stopping. Single-instance results are noise, not signal.
- Surface degradation explicitly in Table A by adding a row `N_dispatched=X, N_received=Y, working_threshold=Z` so the user sees that Phase 5 aggregation used a different threshold than the configured `threshold`. Pass the `working_threshold` (not the configured `threshold`) into the Phase 12 Run parameters report so the trajectory is reproducible.

#### Phase 5: Aggregate (always)

When all N subagents complete, capture HIGH issues and build two tables:

**Table A: Per-instance HIGH count**

| Instance | HIGH count | Main flag content (short) |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | … | … |
| #2 | … | … |
| … | … | … |
| **avg** | **X.X** | |

**Table B: Convergent issues (≥ threshold)**

For each distinct issue mentioned across instances, count how many instances flagged it. Cluster similar findings (same Line + same root cause, even if phrasing differs). Report all issues with count ≥ threshold.

| # | Issue summary | Instances flagged | Count | Known tension? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | … | #1, #3 | 2/3 | ❌ fix candidate |
| B | … | #2 | 1/3 | — (below threshold) |

**Aggregation drift hedge**: Do not unilaterally downgrade subagent verdicts. If you (the main thread) believe an issue at-or-above threshold is actually acceptable, do **not** quietly drop it — surface the disagreement to the user in Phase 6 triage. Main-thread session context biases toward agreement with the user (sycophancy gradient); subagents read in fresh contexts and their independent judgment is the trust anchor of this skill. If you find yourself softening a finding because "it doesn't feel like a defect", that's exactly the drift this hedge prevents — leave the call to the user.

**Scope-narrowing observability (when scope ≠ full)**: if Phase 1.5 set a non-empty `scope_directive` (rule-and-neighbors or section scope), verify Phase 4 instances honored it before trusting aggregation. After all instances complete, compare per-instance input token count against the full-file token count baseline (a workable approximation: byte count of `target_file` read at Phase 3, divided by ~4 chars/token; no token-counting tool is required). If any instance's input tokens exceed 50% of the full-file baseline, that instance likely ignored the scope_directive and read the whole file — warn "scope_directive may not have been honored by instance #X" and surface the offending instance separately so the user can decide whether to re-dispatch it or accept its full-file findings. Without this check, the 1/3–1/5 per-instance token-reduction claim in Phase 1.5 is aspirational, not verified.

---

### Triage

#### Phase 6: Triage + false-positive filter (when convergent issues exist)

For each convergent issue (count ≥ threshold), categorize:

- **Fix candidate**: New reproducible issue not in the exclusion list → forward to Phase 6.5
- **Acceptable**: Matches an exclusion the user provided → note and skip
- **Below threshold**: count < threshold → note in the table but do not propose a fix

If 0 fix candidates remain after this categorization, skip Phases 6.5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11.5(a), 11.5(b), and 11.5(c) entirely — no fix drafting, no application, no re-dispatch — and go directly to Phase 12 (stop check). No fixes were applied this iteration, so Phase 11.5(a)'s "fixes applied" precondition is not met and the re-dispatch has nothing to verify. Phase 12 then stops on the `0 fix candidates from Phase 6` primary stop condition — this is a stop, not a continue, because every primary row in Phase 12's table mandates stop (see Phase 12 lead-in: "Stop and report final state when **any primary** stop condition holds").

#### Phase 6.5: False-positive detection (when fix candidates exist)

Dispatch per the **Verification subagents** table (see below). Filter out FALSE issues — they do not become fix proposals. Surface NEEDS_HUMAN issues to the user in Phase 10 with the agent's reasoning.

#### Phase 7: Redundancy classification (when REAL fix candidates remain)

Dispatch per the **Verification subagents** table. The returned KEEP / SIMPLIFY / REMOVE classification per issue feeds Phase 8 drafting; if the checker returns REMOVE for a rule you believe has unique value, surface the disagreement to the user per Phase 5 drift-hedge.

---

### Fix

#### Phase 8: Fix drafting (when REAL fix candidates remain)

For each REAL fix candidate, draft a fix matching its Phase 7 classification:

- **KEEP** → refine the wording to address the convergent issue
- **SIMPLIFY** → compress the rule to only its unique-value portion (use Phase 7's `suggested_action` as a hint)
- **REMOVE** → delete the rule entirely (optionally with a 1-line pointer to the canonical source)

Read the target file with Read to verify current line numbers and content before drafting.

**Draft mode**

- **Multi-option mode** (2–3 alternatives, each labeled with its trade-off) when the fix is *substantive*: it restructures a rule (move / split / merge), offers a meaningful KEEP vs SIMPLIFY vs REMOVE choice, or changes more than ~3 lines on either side of the diff.
- **Single-proposal mode** (one before/after diff) for ≤ 3-line wording tweaks with no structural change and no meaningful alternative.

When in doubt, use multi-option mode. It shifts the decision from "do you agree with my fix?" to "which alternative fits your intent?" — giving the user more agency on substantive changes, at the cost of one extra option to read.

#### Phase 9: Fix safety check (before showing each fix to user)

Dispatch per the **Verification subagents** table (parallel, one safety-checker per fix or per option in multi-option mode). The orchestrator awaits all completions before Phase 10; each safety-check gates that fix's user approval question.

#### Phase 10: User approval per fix

For each fix candidate, present via **AskUserQuestion**. One question per fix candidate — do not batch.

**Single-proposal mode options:**

- Apply this fix
- Skip (add to exclusion list as architectural tension)
- Modify (user provides alternative wording)

**Multi-option mode options:**

- Option A: [strongest compression — typically REMOVE — with 1-line trade-off label]
- Option B: [middle ground — typically SIMPLIFY]
- Option C: [conservative — typically KEEP with refinement]
- Skip (add to exclusion list)
- Modify (user provides different wording)

Include trade-off labels in option descriptions so the user sees why each option exists.

**User-abort handling**:

- **Modify withdrawn mid-response** (user starts entering alternative wording then cancels) → treat as Skip; add the original fix to the exclusion list and proceed to the next fix candidate.
- **Cancel during a multi-fix sequence** (user explicitly halts in the middle of N fix candidates) → apply the fixes already approved this iteration, skip the remaining unanswered ones, and report them in Phase 12 as `<count> fixes deferred (user canceled)`. Do not silently drop deferred fixes — they appear in the iteration trajectory so the user remembers what's pending.
- **State lost mid-sequence** (a new session is started, orchestrator context is truncated, the user invokes `/clear`, etc., between Phase 10 questions) → on resume, re-Read Phase 6 / Phase 7 outputs and re-present the remaining fixes from where the sequence stopped, not from scratch. AskUserQuestion itself does not time out — it blocks until the user answers — so this branch fires only on actual state loss, not on slow user response.

---

### Apply

#### Phase 11: Apply via Edit (when fixes approved)

**Pre-check for line-range conflicts (Phase 11 sequencing).** Two interacting concerns sit in front of the first Edit: line-range conflicts (cross-fix overlap and line-shift after a fix lands) and classifier authorization. Resolve in this order: (1) classifier pre-authorize (next paragraph) for the target as a whole, so user authorization is paid once up front; (2) line-range conflict pre-check and per-fix apply, described here.

The main thread (not a subagent) performs the conflict pre-check using the approved-this-iteration fixes as input. Phase 9 (`fix-safety-checker`) judges each fix in isolation and does NOT detect inter-fix line-range conflicts. There are two distinct conflict shapes to guard against:

- **Overlap** — two fixes' `line_range` intervals intersect, or sit within ±2 lines of each other (chosen as a small buffer so a fix that edits L97–L99 and another that edits L100 are treated as a single span; the buffer is heuristic, not load-bearing). If two SAFE fixes both rewrite the same span, the second Edit can fail (the `before` text no longer matches after the first Edit lands) or — worse — land in a wrong location and silently corrupt the file.
- **Line-shift propagation** — even fixes whose `line_range` intervals do NOT overlap can still corrupt each other when an earlier fix changes the total line count (INSERT-class fix adds lines, REMOVE-class fix deletes lines). After such a fix lands, every downstream fix's `line_range` is stale by the delta — its `before` text may now resolve to the wrong location even though there was no direct overlap.

Sequencing algorithm:

1. **Group transitively by overlap**: build groups where any pair of fixes within the group overlaps (or is within ±2 lines) of at least one other fix in the same group. For `{A: L10-15, B: L17-20, C: L22-25}` with the ±2 buffer, A↔B overlap (gap of 1 line, within buffer) and B↔C overlap (gap of 1 line, within buffer) — A, B, C form a single transitive group even though A↔C do not directly overlap.
2. **Order groups bottom-up by max line number** so earlier Edits land in later parts of the file first, minimizing line-shift impact on later groups. This is the standard "edit-from-bottom" pattern; it converts an INSERT/REMOVE in a later group from "shifts line numbers of upstream fixes" into "shifts line numbers of fixes already applied" (no-op).
3. **For each group, apply fixes one at a time, sorted bottom-up by `line_range.start` within the group** (so within-group apply order is reproducible: max-start first, then descending; ties broken by max-end then lexicographic `issue_id`): (a) issue Edit for the first fix in the group, (b) re-Read the affected line range plus ±10 lines, (c) for each remaining fix in the group, recompute its `line_range` against the new file content and re-verify that its `before` text still matches verbatim. If `before` no longer matches: dispatch a fresh `fix-safety-checker` subagent on the updated `before` + `after` to re-verify, since the original Phase 9 verdict applied to a pre-Edit file state and is now stale. **If this re-check returns UNSAFE, surface the conflict origin explicitly to the user before falling through to Phase 9's escalation machinery — the user sees "fix #X became UNSAFE because fix #Y landed first and shifted the file" prefix, then the Apply / Skip / Modify options. The Phase 11 re-check path intentionally skips Phase 9's "re-draft once before escalating" stage (the re-draft is a Phase 8 author's response to the original `before` text; once `before` has shifted, re-drafting needs the new pre-Edit file state, which is what Modify covers). Cap the user-driven Modify loop at 3 retries per fix: if the user picks Modify 3 times and each Modify still triggers UNSAFE on re-check, force a Skip with a notice so the loop cannot run unbounded.** Do not silently apply.
4. **Between groups, also re-Read the file** (single Read of the full file is sufficient — the orchestrator already has Read budget for this) to refresh line numbers for the next group, since prior groups' Edits shifted them.
5. **No `Apply-as-is` fast-path that bypasses Phase 9 re-verification** — bypassing the safety check on stale `before` text is exactly the silent-corruption mode this pre-check exists to prevent.

Edge cases:

- **Single-fix iteration** — no conflicts possible, skip the pre-check entirely.
- **All fixes in one group** — the algorithm degenerates to fully sequential apply with re-verification, which is the safe behavior.
- **Group with REMOVE fixes only** — line-shift in the negative direction is still propagated by the bottom-up ordering, no special handling.

**Pre-authorize when target is on the classifier trigger list.** For any `claude-md` target or installed `skill-md` target (see trigger-location tables in `references/claude-md-specifics.md` and `references/skill-md-specifics.md`), the classifier trigger is deterministic — issuing Edit first WILL block. Ask for authorization BEFORE issuing Edit, using **AskUserQuestion** with the "Yes, update my `<file>`" template from the playbook. **The classifier's exact release semantics on prior pre-authorization (vs the documented "release on retry after authorization" path) have not been empirically verified by this skill** — treat the pre-authorize variant as best-effort. If the first Edit still blocks despite prior authorization, retry once with the same authorization in context; the playbook's documented retry release applies. If the second Edit also blocks, fall back to the standard reactive playbook flow. Either way, asking first eliminates the "block → think → look up playbook → ask → answer" thinking round-trip that the purely reactive path costs.

For targets NOT on the trigger list, just use **Edit** directly. If the classifier still blocks (rare), fall back to the playbook in `references/claude-md-specifics.md` reactively — it owns the canonical trigger-location table and the "Yes, update my `<file>`" authorization template. For SKILL.md location nuances (marketplace source vs installed), see `references/skill-md-specifics.md` "Phase 11 location-aware classifier behavior".

After all Edit calls, briefly confirm what was applied. The confirmation lists each applied fix in **Phase 10 approval order** (not the bottom-up apply order Phase 11 sequencing used), so the user can match what they approved against what landed. Prefix the list with a one-line note if any group was re-sequenced — e.g., "applied in 2 groups, bottom-up within each group for line-shift safety; ordering shown below is your Phase 10 approval order:". Format: file list + 1-line description per fix.

#### Phase 11.5: Post-fix verify

Run the applicable verification layers:

- **11.5(a) Audit re-dispatch (always when fixes applied and iteration < max_iterations)** → re-dispatch N subagents (same prompt, with updated exclusion list if any added in Phase 10) and repeat Phases 4–6. If new fix candidates appear, run the full Phase 6.5–11 cycle. Phase 3 `section_purposes` are stable across iterations and re-passed unchanged unless the user explicitly says the section structure changed
- **11.5(b) A/B benchmark (only when `ab_testing_enabled: true` AND `skill-eval` is installed externally)** → see `references/ab-testing.md`. Runs `skill-eval`'s with/without comparison on a user-supplied benchmark task set, before vs after the iteration's fixes. The skill does NOT automatically curate the task set — the user must provide it. If `skill-eval` is not available, Phase 11.5(b) is skipped with a warning even when `ab_testing_enabled: true` (the user opted in but the dependency is missing; surface this prominently so the user can install skill-eval and re-run, or accept the audit without A/B verification)
- **11.5(c) Static re-check (only when `target_type == "skill-md"` and Phase 2.5 ran)** → re-execute `skill-eval`'s `static_check.py` on the target. Result feeds the Phase 12 ship-ready stop criterion. If Phase 2.5 was skipped (skill-eval unavailable), Phase 11.5(c) is automatically skipped too

---

### Verify

#### Phase 12: Stop condition check (always after each iteration)

Stop and report final state when **any primary** stop condition holds. The ship-ready row at the bottom is **additive** — it never stops the workflow on its own, it only enriches a primary stop's final report when also satisfied.

| Condition | Type | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| All N instances report "NO HIGH ISSUES" | primary | Full convergence — file is clean |
| At least `(N − threshold + 1)` instances report "NO HIGH ISSUES" (default: ≥2 of 3 when N=3 / threshold=2) | primary | Practical convergence — even if every remaining instance flagged the same issue, it could not reach `threshold`, so no reproducible defect can remain |
| HIGH avg plateau for 2 consecutive iterations (avg change < 1) | primary | Structural limit reached — remaining issues are likely deliberate design / architectural tensions |
| iteration ≥ `max_iterations` | primary | Hard limit — report current state, flag the asymptote explicitly |
| 0 fix candidates from Phase 6 | primary | Nothing actionable left |
| Phase 11.5(c) static.json reports `score == 1.0 AND warnings == 0` (SKILL.md target only, when Phase 2.5 ran) | additive | Structurally ship-ready on the static layer. When ALSO combined with full convergence or practical convergence above, report "both layers clean". Never a standalone stop: if no primary row holds, do not stop on this row alone, and conversely `warnings > 0` alone is not a stop reason either — only the absence of primary stop conditions is. |

**Derivation of `(N − threshold + 1)` (practical-convergence row).** If `(N − threshold + 1)` instances independently report "NO HIGH ISSUES", then at most `threshold − 1` instances could still flag any given issue. Since the convergence rule requires `≥ threshold` instances to flag the same issue before it counts as a real defect, no reproducible defect can possibly remain — even in the worst case where every remaining instance flagged the same thing. For defaults `N=3 / threshold=2`, this is `≥ 2 of 3` reporting clean. This stop condition is target-type agnostic (applies to both `claude-md` and `skill-md` targets) — keep the derivation here rather than in target-specifics docs.

Report the iteration history (Phase 5 tables across all iterations) so the user can see the trajectory.

## Audit prompt

The audit prompt lives in `agents/auditor.md`. Phase 4 reads that file and uses its full content as the subagent prompt (with placeholders substituted). The 7 axes, the "no collusion" framing, the strict HIGH-only filter, and the exclusion handling are file-type agnostic and have been validated on both CLAUDE.md and SKILL.md targets.

Do not duplicate the prompt here. The single source of truth is `agents/auditor.md`. Editing the prompt means editing that file.

## Verification subagents

Phase 6.5, 7, and 9 each dispatch a specialized verification subagent. Dispatch shape, inputs, and verdict handling are consolidated here so each Phase section can stay short.

| Phase | Agent prompt file | Dispatch | Inputs | Verdict handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6.5 | `agents/false-positive-detector.md` | 1 subagent, foreground, parent model | `target_file`; `related_files` (project CLAUDE.md / settings.json / etc.); `convergent_issues` (fix candidates from Phase 6); `exclusion_list` (current, including items added this iteration); `known_fp_patterns` (union of the target-type specifics document's "Common shared-blind-spot patterns" section + `references/shared-blind-spots.md` entries — assembled at Phase 2 and reused unchanged across iterations unless either file is edited mid-audit) | REAL → forward to Phase 7. FALSE → drop. NEEDS_HUMAN → surface in Phase 10 with agent reasoning. The known-FP shortcut at step 0 of the agent's Task is the documented fast-path; only issues that fall through it require the agent's independent re-read. |
| 7 | `agents/redundancy-checker.md` | 1 subagent, foreground, parent model | `target_file`; `target_type` (selects upstream-reference set: Claude Code defaults for `claude-md`, sibling skills for `skill-md`); `convergent_issues` (REAL from Phase 6.5, with cited section text ±10 lines); `section_purposes` (from Phase 3); `sibling_skills` for `skill-md` only — resolution chain (in order, first non-empty wins): (1) walk up parent dirs ≤6 levels for `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` then glob `<marketplace_root>/plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`, (2) installed-plugin cache `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`, (3) all-marketplaces cache fallback, (4) `SKILL_EVAL_SKILLS_DIR` env-var glob, (5) user-supplied manual list at Phase 2, (6) empty fallback (Phase 7 still compares against `skill-creator` as the always-relevant authority). Full details in `references/skill-md-specifics.md` Marketplace root detection. | Returns KEEP / SIMPLIFY / REMOVE per issue, used by Phase 8 to choose draft mode. |
| 9 | `agents/fix-safety-checker.md` | 1 subagent per fix candidate (or per option in multi-option mode), parallel in a **single tool-call message** with `run_in_background: true`, parent model | `target_file`; `issue_summary` (1-2 lines); `proposed_fix` (before/after diff + rationale + Phase 7 classification); `section_purposes` (from Phase 3 as authoritative intent baseline — do not re-derive from file content) | SAFE → present in Phase 10. UNSAFE → re-draft addressing concerns **once**, then re-run safety-check; if second pass also UNSAFE, escalate to user (present original in Phase 10 with safety reasoning as explicit warning, let user choose Apply / Skip / Modify). NEEDS_REVIEW → present with trade-offs in AskUserQuestion description. `rule_burden_impact: INCREASES_MAJOR` → surface prominently regardless of verdict. |

## Output format

After all iterations complete, present a final report. The **Run parameters** block is required — it lets the user verify which configuration produced the trajectory below, especially when defaults were overridden at Phase 2.

## Tool requirements

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `Agent` | Parallel subagent dispatch (Phase 4 audit, Phase 6.5 false-positive, Phase 7 redundancy, Phase 9 safety). `run_in_background: true` for Phase 4 (N parallel auditors); Phase 6.5 / 7 each run a single subagent (`run_in_background: false` is fine since there is nothing to parallelize with); Phase 9 dispatches 1 per fix candidate (or 1 per option) in parallel within a **single tool-call message** with `run_in_background: true` and awaits all completions before Phase 10 (the orchestrator gates each Phase 10 approval question on its safety-checker result) |
| `Read` | Phase 1 (read `references/symptom-interview-protocol.md`); Phase 3 (section purposes); verify line numbers before Phase 8 drafting; read `agents/*.md` when dispatching specialized subagents; read `references/<target_type>-specifics.md` at Phase 2; read `references/shared-blind-spots.md` at Phase 2 (always, regardless of target_type — feeds the union into `known_fp_patterns` per the Verification subagents table Phase 6.5 row); read `references/ab-testing.md` at Phase 2 when `ab_testing_enabled` is being decided; Phase 11 conflict pre-check (re-Read the affected range ±10 lines between Edits in an overlap group, plus a full-file re-Read between groups) |
| `AskUserQuestion` | Phase 1 symptom interview, Phase 1.5 scope confirmation, Phase 2 setup (incl. input-validation re-ask up to 3 times before abort), Phase 3 section purposes confirmation, Phase 10 fix approval, Phase 11 auto-mode classifier authorization (per `references/claude-md-specifics.md`), Phase 11 overlap-conflict resolution (when re-Read shows a fix's `before` text has been invalidated) — never use plain-text questions per CLAUDE.md communication rule |
| `Edit` | Apply approved fixes; follow `references/claude-md-specifics.md` playbook when blocked |
| `Glob` (or `Bash` `bfs` on native builds where `Glob` is unavailable) | Phase 7 sibling-skill discovery (`target_type == "skill-md"` only) |
| `Bash` | Phase 2.5 / 11.5(c) `skill-eval static_check.py` execution; Phase 11.5(b) optional `skill-eval` benchmark execution |

## Common pitfalls

See `references/pitfalls.md` for the grouped list (workflow / aggregation / fix-proposal / target-specific). Consult it when a phase isn't behaving as expected or when onboarding.

## Cost notes

Cost scales with `N`, `max_iterations`, and the number of REAL fix candidates that survive Phase 6.5/7.

| Tier | N / threshold | Phase 4 audit dispatch (approx, Sonnet-pinned) | Verification overhead per iteration (Phase 6.5/7/9, parent model) | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quick (default) | 3 / 2 | ~150k tokens | +20–80k tokens (scales with fix candidate count) | Symptom-driven diagnostic; standard event-driven use |
| Standard | 5 / 3 | ~280k tokens | +20–80k tokens | When N=3 convergence feels weak |
| Deep (opt-in) | 9 / 4 | ~440k tokens | +20–80k tokens | Pre-shipping check on a high-leverage instruction file, or when N=3 / 5 didn't converge |

**Parent-model multiplier.** Phase 4 is Sonnet-pinned but Phases 6.5/7/9 inherit the parent model. At an Opus parent session, verification overhead is priced at Opus rates, so a Quick-tier iteration with 3 fix candidates totals roughly 250–300k tokens (150k audit + ~100–150k verification at Opus), not 150k. Multiply that by `max_iterations` (default 3) for the full audit budget. Phase 11.5(b) A/B benchmark multiplies per-iteration cost — see `references/ab-testing.md` cost table; the multiplier ranges from roughly 1.7× (small task / trial counts) up to ~9× (large task × trial counts) depending on the user-supplied benchmark configuration. Use the table to estimate before enabling.

**Numbers are inferred, not measured.** The "+20–80k" verification range and the Opus 1.5–2× multiplier are derived from per-phase prompt size estimates, not from logged Phase 6.5/7/9 token counts in actual runs. The "+20–80k" range assumes a typical ≤3 fix candidates and counts Phase 6.5 + 7 + 9 combined. For defect-rich files (5+ candidates × multi-option mode dispatching 10–15 safety-checkers), **Phase 9 alone** can reach the 300–750k range (10–15 × ~30–50k each), pushing total verification overhead well above the headline upper bound. See the third bullet under "Known limitations" below for the same arithmetic stated from Phase 9's perspective. Adjust based on observed token usage from your own audits — if you have data, update this table.

Surface the estimated total cost at Phase 2 so the user can downsize before dispatch. The cost is justified when the file is high-leverage (loaded into every Claude session) and an event-driven symptom triggered the audit. For routine maintenance, the cost is not justified — this skill is the wrong tool for that use case.

## Known limitations

Items the user should be aware of before invoking. None of these prevent the skill from working — they bound how much you can trust its results.

- **In-session triggering recall is unmeasured.** The only triggering measurement we have runs through the `skill-creator/run_loop.py` (`claude -p`) backend, where the skill recorded **recall = 0% on the 4 should-trigger evals that existed at measurement time** (then ids 1–4). A 5th should-trigger eval (id 8, deep-tier N=9 opt-in) was added after that measurement and has not been recall-measured. The `claude -p` triggering path is documented as different from the in-session triggering path the user actually experiences, but no in-session re-measurement has been performed for any of the should-trigger evals. Practically: if you do not invoke the skill explicitly (e.g., via the `/parallel-audit:parallel-audit` command or by naming the skill in your prompt), the executor **may silently not trigger it** even on a clearly in-scope request. We recommend invoking it explicitly until the in-session recall is benchmarked.
- **End-to-end behavioral benchmarks do not exist for should-trigger evals.** The 5 should-trigger evals in `evals/evals.json` (current ids 1–4 plus id 8) are verified via trace review (reading SKILL.md prose and judging assertion clarity), not via end-to-end execution, because Phase 1 / 2 / 3 / 10 / 11 `AskUserQuestion` calls block subagent runs. The 3 should-not-trigger evals (ids 5–7) are end-to-end benchmarked. So the workflow's *correctness against the spec* is verified for negative cases only; for positive cases we have spec-coherence, not behavior.
- **Phase 9 fan-out cost can exceed the headline range.** The cost table's "+20–80k" verification overhead is a typical-case estimate that assumes ≤ 3 fix candidates. For defect-rich files with 5+ fix candidates × multi-option mode (2–3 options each), Phase 9 alone can dispatch 10–15 safety-checkers at ~30–50k each, putting Phase 9 in the 300–750k range — 4–9× the table's upper bound. This is hedged at the "Numbers are inferred, not measured" sentence above, but if you expect a defect-rich file, budget closer to 2× the headline tier number.
- **External-target operating sample size is small.** The workflow has been exercised end-to-end on `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (~17KB, 5 convergent issues found) and self-tested on this skill's own SKILL.md. No broader sample of external targets has been audited, so behaviors specific to less-common shapes (very short SKILL.md, files with unusual heading conventions, etc.) are unobserved.

If you hit one of these in practice, log it in `docs/learnings/parallel-audit.md` so the next maintenance pass can close the gap.
