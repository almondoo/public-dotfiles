# Tester request consolidation + Lead direct-verification — detailed reference

The Tester is the teammate that consumes context most heavily during a wave. Repeated per-commit requests have caused unresponsiveness incidents multiple times, so we define consolidation principles and a fallback route.

## 1. Tester request consolidation principle

**Consolidate Tester requests into a single full regression at the end of the wave**. Per-commit unit-test verification requests are forbidden.

### Why

- Implementers always report a green `<TEST_RUNNER_COMMAND> <target>` (e.g. `bun vitest run <path>`, `pytest <path>`) when they request a commit (self-verification)
- The Reviewer has already approved from a code perspective → these two layers establish per-commit quality
- Asking the Tester to verify every commit means 6+1=7 heavy Bash invocations per wave (6 commits), and the cumulative context pressure causes **unresponsiveness in the latter half of the wave**
  - Real incident: in a past pair of waves, the Tester returned only idle notifications at the final-regression stage and stopped responding with content
  - In subsequent waves, with per-commit requests removed, the unresponsiveness pattern did not recur

### Flow after consolidation

```
Per commit:
  Implementer self-verification → Lead commit → Reviewer review (do NOT call Tester)

End of wave (all commits + all fix commits done + all Reviewer PASS):
  Lead → SendMessage to Tester: "Please run the final full regression" (once only)
    - <FULL_TEST_COMMAND>      # e.g. `bun run test:unit`, `pnpm test`, `pytest`
    - <TYPECHECK_COMMAND>      # e.g. `bun --filter '*' typecheck && bun run typecheck`, `tsc -b`, `mypy .`
    - <LINT_COMMAND>           # e.g. `bun --filter '*' lint && bun run lint`, `eslint .`, `ruff check`
    - git log --stat to confirm each commit's per-path staging
  Tester returns PASS / FAIL in 3 lines (no details needed on PASS)
```

## 2. Lightweight Tester output format

The canonical format (`On PASS` 3-5 lines / `On FAIL` blocker details / "Not needed" exclusions) lives in `assets/spawn-prompts/tester.md` under "Output format". The Lead's responsibility here is to make sure that template is the one substituted into the Tester's spawn prompt, not a verbose hand-written variant.

Why the cap on verbosity: tables, line-number-annotated analysis, and per-metric verdicts are the Reviewer's territory; folding them into the Tester accelerates context pressure and raises the risk of late-wave unresponsiveness.

## 3. Lead direct-verification route

The Lead may run verification commands directly via Bash in two distinct cases:

- **Small waves (standard path, not a fallback)**: Small waves have no dedicated Tester per the composition table, so the Lead runs the final regression directly via this route as the canonical Phase 4 mechanism. See SKILL.md Phase 4 step 2.
- **Medium / Large waves (Tester-unresponsiveness fallback)**: when the spawned Tester becomes unresponsive (returns only idle notifications, no content responses), the Lead switches to this route as an emergency fallback.

### Why this does not bypass the quality gate

- `<FULL_TEST_COMMAND>` / `<TYPECHECK_COMMAND>` / `<LINT_COMMAND>` are **read-only objective verification** (zero code changes)
- The result is settled by numeric output, leaving no room for the Lead's subjective judgment
- Per-commit quality is already established by Implementer self-verification + Reviewer PASS; the Tester's final regression mainly confirms "post-accumulation consistency"

### Execution steps

1. Ping the Tester after the expected time elapses (typical full-stack: ~1-2 min; 3× = anomaly threshold ~6 min) → only idle notifications, no content → re-request → same
2. The Lead runs directly via Bash:
   ```bash
   <FULL_TEST_COMMAND> 2>&1 | tail -5     # e.g. bun run test:unit
   <TYPECHECK_COMMAND>                     # e.g. bun --filter '*' typecheck && bun run typecheck
   <LINT_COMMAND>                          # e.g. bun --filter '*' lint && bun run lint
   git log --stat main..HEAD | head -50
   git status
   ```
3. If numbers satisfy requirements (counts / 0 errors / no off-target contamination), judge PASS
4. When sending shutdown_request, state explicitly "Tester response missing, so the Lead verified on its behalf"

### Tester-unresponsiveness preventive measures

- Enforce the "Tester request consolidation" above (do not send per-commit requests)
- Specify lightweight output format in the spawn prompt
- Expected Tester time = `max(60s, tests count / 100 + 30s)`; flag as anomalous if exceeded 3×

## 4. Expected-time table

| Verification type | Expected time | Anomaly detection (3×) |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Single unit-test file (~30-50 tests) | 1-5 sec | 15 sec |
| One wave's unit tests (~6 files / ~200 tests) | 5-15 sec | 45 sec |
| `<FULL_TEST_COMMAND>` (~3000-3500 tests) | 20-30 sec | 1.5 min |
| typecheck (workspace + root) | 10-30 sec | 1.5 min |
| lint (workspace + root) | 5-15 sec | 45 sec |
| All four combined | ~1-2 min | 6 min |

If you exceed 3×, treat as anomalous: send a status-check ping + re-request. If still no response, switch to the Lead direct-verification route.
